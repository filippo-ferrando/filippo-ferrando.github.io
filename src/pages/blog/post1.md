**Hi everyone!** this is my personal portfolio in version **3.0** with also a blog attached!
I'll be using this space to talk about what I study/am passionate about, so mainly tweaks, distros, and other things related to the linux world, but also networking, maybe programming, and anything else I can think of!<br><br>
From this portfolio you can contact me via **telegram** and **email**, feel free to do so! any kind of suggestion, help or even just a hello is welcome!
