							<p>
								Beyond my studies in Cybersecurity at Politecnico di Torino, I work with
								<a href="https://elemento.cloud" target="_blank" class="underline font-semibold hover:text-blue-400 transition-colors">Elemento Cloud</a>
								where we're <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">revolutionizing the cloud services industry</span>. 
								It's fascinating to apply what I learn academically to real-world problems in distributed systems and infrastructure security.
							</p>

							<p>
								My <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">passion for karting</span> runs deep and has shaped much of who I am. 
								What started as weekend fun evolved into serious mechanical knowledge about <span class="font-semibold">2-stroke engines</span> — from understanding combustion physics to advanced tuning techniques.
								I've spent countless hours reading technical manuals, experimenting with setups, and getting my hands dirty.
								These days, I channel this expertise as a <span class="font-semibold">mechanic for a racing team</span>, supporting a young driver competing in an Italian championships.
							</p>

							<p>
								Music has been my constant companion since childhood. I started with <span class="font-semibold">classical guitar</span> at age 6, spending nearly a decade mastering traditional techniques and repertoire.
								Now I focus on <span class="font-semibold">electric guitar</span>, exploring everything from jazz fusion to progressive rock.
								There's something magical about the intersection of technical precision and creative expression that appeals to the same part of me drawn to both engineering and racing.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the tech world, I'm particularly fascinated by <span class="font-semibold text-blue-400">virtualization and containerization technologies</span>.
								My focus on <span class="font-semibold">open-source solutions</span> like <span class="font-semibold">KVM</span> and <span class="font-semibold">Docker</span> stems from both philosophical and practical reasons — 
								I believe in transparent, auditable systems, especially when security is paramount.
								Currently, I'm diving deep into orchestration platforms and exploring how to optimize system efficiency at scale.
