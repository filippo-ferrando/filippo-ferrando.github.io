                Beyond my studies in Cybersecurity at Politecnico di Torino, I
                work with
                <a

                  >revolutionizing the cloud services industry</span
                >. It's fascinating to apply what I learn academically to
                real-world problems in distributed systems and infrastructure
                security.

                My <span class="font-semibold text-gruvbox-orange"
                  >passion for karting</span
                > runs deep and has shaped much of who I am. What started as weekend
                fun evolved into serious mechanical knowledge about <span
                  class="font-semibold">2-stroke engines</span
                > — from understanding combustion physics to advanced tuning techniques.
                I've spent countless hours reading technical manuals, experimenting
                with setups, and getting my hands dirty. These days, I channel this
                expertise as a <span class="font-semibold"
                  >mechanic for a racing team</span
                >, supporting a young driver competing in an Italian
                championships.
              </p>

              <p>
                Music has been my constant companion since childhood. I started
                with <span class="font-semibold">classical guitar</span> at age 6,
                spending nearly a decade mastering traditional techniques and repertoire.
                Now I focus on <span class="font-semibold">electric guitar</span
                >, exploring everything from jazz fusion to progressive rock.
                There's something magical about the intersection of technical
                precision and creative expression that appeals to the same part
                of me drawn to both engineering and racing.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the tech world, I'm particularly fascinated by <span
                  class="font-semibold text-gruvbox-aqua"
                  >virtualization and containerization technologies</span
                >. My focus on <span class="font-semibold"
                  >open-source solutions</span
                > like <span class="font-semibold">KVM</span> and <span
                  class="font-semibold">Docker</span
                > stems from both philosophical and practical reasons — I believe
                in transparent, auditable systems, especially when security is paramount.
                Currently, I'm diving deep into orchestration platforms and exploring
                how to optimize system efficiency at scale.
