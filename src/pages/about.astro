                <p>I'm Filippo Ferrando, a Computer Science student at the University of Turin with a strong passion for racing and technology. My core competencies include networking, programming, and managing Unix-based systems.</p>
                <p>I consider myself a determined individual, always eager to learn new things, independent, and capable of solving various problems.</p>

            <p>Alongside my university studies, I work with <a href="https://elemento.cloud" target="_blank" class="underline">Elemento Cloud</a> to revolutionize the cloud services industry.</p>
      
            <p>My passion for karting has provided me with extensive knowledge of mechanics and driving. This enthusiasm led me to delve deeper into 2-stroke engines, exploring topics from basic physical phenomena to advanced tuning techniques. I've read numerous books on the subject and conducted experiments at home. Currently, I spend weekends working as a mechanic for a karting team, supporting a young driver competing in an Italian single-brand championship.</p>
      
            <p>I've been playing the guitar since the age of 6, dedicating nearly a decade to classical guitar studies and now focusing on electric guitar.</p>
      
            <p>I am particularly interested in virtualization and containerization technologies, with a strong focus on open-source solutions. I am currently working with tools such as KVM and Docker to optimize system efficiency and scalability.</p>
