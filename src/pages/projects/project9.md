# Telegram controlled Homelab

### The problem 
Lately I've finally moved my rack to another floor in my house.
This on the one hand is more convenient in terms of space management, but brings a series of complications from the management and maintenance of the servers inside the rack; Furthermore, with the fact that I live (almost) permanently in Turin to pursue my university studies, finding a solution to take a quick look at the situation of the machines becomes an imperative.

### My solution
Telegram. <br>
Telegram is an application that makes remote communication between man and machine relatively easy thanks to bots. <br>
Using the Telegram API and a bit of python code I'm developing a script to be able to execute commands on the servers, check the status of the containers or simply see if all the hosts are up
<br>
<br>
You can see the code written so far on my github repo dedicated to this project, any kind of contribution is welcome!
