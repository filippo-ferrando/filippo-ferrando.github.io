  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    Hi! I'm Filippo Ferrando, a CS Student with the passion of racing, my strengths are definitely networking, programming and usage | management of unix-based systems.<br><br>

    I consider myself a stubborn person but always ready to learn something new, independent and capable of solving problems of various kinds.<br><br>

    I have different passions such as Karting where I have learned many notions of mechanics and driving this passion made me much more involved in knowing more about 2-stroke engine, from basic physical phenomena to more advanced tuning so i've read many books on the argument and made some little experimentation at home.<br>
    I'm now working some weekends as a mechanic in a karting team, i'm following a young pilot who is competing in an Italian single-brand championship.<br><br>

    Also i'm a guitar player from the age of 6, i've studied classical guitar almost for 10 years and now i'm studying electric guitar.<br><br>

    I am very interested in the field of study I am following now, the topics that attract me most are Blockchain technologies, IoT and cybersecurity, i'm planning (after the bachelor degree @ UniTo) to undertake the studies of Cyber Security (although I have yet to decide which university) to perhaps become a Cyber Designer.<br><br>

    Working in the Computer Science (or actually any tech-related) field is not reduced only to carrying out the work itself, I believe instead that it is a way of approaching life; this sector requires constant updating of one's skills to always keep up and not everyone is willing to follow such a path. On my Github you can find more technical information about my skills.
