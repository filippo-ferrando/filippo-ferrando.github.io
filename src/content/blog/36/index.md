# First tests on auto-publishing posts on Mastodon!
From now on, my blog posts will be posted also on mastodon!

## How ?
if you're interested on how to do this you can check out my [github repository](https://github.com/filippo-ferrando/filippo-ferrando.github.io) and check the file stored in `.github/workflows/publish-to-mastodon`

## Why?
Well, i get bored easily and this was a great way to spend a boring morning here in Turin!
